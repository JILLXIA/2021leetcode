/**
 * There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane.
 * The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where
 * points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter
 * stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
 *
 * Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction)
 * from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend
 * is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
 *
 * Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that
 * must be shot to burst all balloons.
