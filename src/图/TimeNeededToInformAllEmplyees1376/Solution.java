/**
 * A company has n employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1.
 * The head of the company is the one with headID.
 *
 * Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where manager[i]
 * is the direct manager of the i-th employee, manager[headID] = -1. Also,
 * it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.
 *
 * The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an
 * urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform
 * their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.
 *
 * The i-th employee needs informTime[i] minutes to inform all of his direct
 * subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can
 * start spreading the news).
 *
 * Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.
