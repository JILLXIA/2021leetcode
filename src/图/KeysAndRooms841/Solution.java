 * There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked
 * except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms.
 * However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
 *
 * When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it.
 * Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
 *
 * Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys
 * that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can
 * visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
