/**
 * You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2
 * containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land).
 * An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.
 *
 * An island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an
 * island in grid1 that contains all the cells that make up this
 * island in grid2.
 *
 * Return the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.
